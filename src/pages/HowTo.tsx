            <p>The SOS button is accessible from main page of the application, the dashboard. Click on it in case of emergency. When you do this, the following will happen:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A thirty-second timer will begin to count down. During this time you have the option to select the specific emergency type, or cancel the SOS.</li>
                <li>If a specific emergency type is selected, the custom message you have set for this emergency type and your location will then be dispatched to your nominated contacts by text message. You will be notified of their response.</li>
                <li>If no emergency type is selected, and the SOS is not cancelled, a generic emergency message will be sent to your contact list with your location.</li>
            </ol>
